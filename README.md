# **Hey There!**

🎓 Computer science student at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga 🕊️ with a knack for turning algorithms into action. Currently sporting a solid GPA of 3.10 as I navigate through the maze of code and classes.

💻 I'm deeply engaged in honing my skills in Python, diving into data science, and exploring the vast world of computer science. From dissecting algorithms to crafting elegant solutions, I'm always eager to push the boundaries of my knowledge.

📚 Outside of the tech world, you'll find me riding my vintage stand up JetSki on the Old Hickory Lake, collaborating on coding projects with classmates, or cheering on our UTC Mocs 🏈. Balancing academics with extracurriculars keeps me grounded and motivated.

🚀 I am always down to collaborate on projects. I find teamwork and knowledge learned as a group to be extremely valuable to not only me, but everyone envolved. If you ever want to team-up on any group projects, feel free to drop me a message. 🌟
